This project demonstrates the A (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm* using Python and Pygame. It provides a visual, interactive representation of how A* finds the shortest path between two points on a grid while avoiding obstacles.

The project is designed to help students and developers understand pathfinding algorithms, heuristics, and their applications in AI, robotics, games, and GPS navigation systems.
